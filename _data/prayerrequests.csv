That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

4,"John 1:1-14, ESV

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.","Missionaries - Pray for missionaries who work hard to share the gospel with those who have never heard.

Join us in praying that the evangelistic efforts during the games will produce biblically faithful, reproducing churches who send to the nations from every borough, town, and village.","Athletics in the Olympics includes 18 different types of events for both men and women, everything from sprints to long-distance running to relay races.

To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

	The heavens declare the glory of God,
		and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
	Day to day pours out speech,
		and night to night reveals knowledge.

Just as athletes need time to rest their bodies, pray for believers in this part of the world to take time to be still, quiet their hearts, and let God minister to their needs.

Pray that vibrant new congregations would fill the space between old empty cathedrals. ",Sri Lanka has been preparing for the Summer Olympics with their “Road to Paris” program.

Many European Olympians represent countries that have become home though their family roots stem from non-European countries.

European peoples are also mobile as they shift from East to Western Europe in search for economic stability and possibility. The generations that follow these movements become assimilated into their host countries but remain attached and aware of the cultural norms and practices of their heritage. These generations are critical to gospel movement throughout Europe. Pray for open hearts and salvations among this bridge generation. Pray for the believers from the global south who are making a home in Europe to become harvest laborers who will cross-culturally engage the peoples and places around them. ",

12,"Matthew 9:35-38, ESV

And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.

There is much opposition to those who choose to leave Islam and follow Christ, so please pray for believers to remain strong in the face of persecution. Just as Bangladeshi athletes press on to try to win a medal for their country, pray that Bangladeshi Christians will press on to win the prize for which God has called them heavenward in Christ Jesus.  (Philippians 4:13, NIV)",

Much like the Olympic events, it is also held every 4 years. Although Deaf athletes cannot be guided by sounds as they might in other sporting events, lights or flags are used to start races and applause or cheering is not customary in the stands. Pray for Deaf athletes to come to know the one true God. Pray for this gathering of Deaf peoples to be an opportune place for gospel flow.",
